# Active Context

## Current Focus
Now that the homepage, featured posts, infinite scroll, and single-post pages are all working, the focus shifts to implementing category archive pages and search, plus polishing media handling and SEO.

## Recent Changes
- Fixed Docker environment issues including container configuration
- Fixed environment variable encoding issues
- Added netcat to Django Dockerfile for proper connection waiting
- Created and configured Django manage.py file
- Properly configured ALLOWED_HOSTS for Django
- Fixed CORS configuration to properly format origins list
- Created Django superuser for admin access
- Built and compiled Next.js frontend with TypeScript
- Implemented basic frontend with Tailwind CSS
- Set up dark/light mode theming
- Verified connectivity between all services
- Created PostCard component with support for:
  - Featured post highlighting
  - Category display and linking
  - Responsive image handling
  - Dark/light mode compatibility
  - Reading time and publication date display
- Planned homepage implementation with featured posts and infinite scroll
- Created API client (api.ts) for fetching posts and featured posts
- Implemented FeaturedPosts component for the homepage
- Created PostGrid component with infinite scroll using Intersection Observer
- Updated homepage to use server-side rendering for initial data
- Implemented error handling and loading states throughout
- Registered Post model in Django admin and improved list display
- Added `admin.site.site_url` override to point to Next.js frontend
- Added `lookup_field = 'slug'` to PostViewSet for slug-based retrieval
- Added `getPost` API function and updated `Post` interface (`content` field)
- Created dynamic Next.js route `pages/posts/[slug].tsx` with SSR and Markdown rendering
- Installed `react-markdown` & `remark-gfm` for rich content display
- Added `next.config.js` with remote image patterns (django & localhost) to fix hostname error
- Updated Django `ALLOWED_HOSTS` and CORS to include `django`
- Single post detail page now renders correctly with images
- Implemented category archive page on frontend with SSR and infinite scroll

## Next Steps
- Implement search (full-text against Postgres) and search UI
- Add newsletter subscription component
- Optimize media handling (image optimisation, placeholders)
- Add social sharing buttons on post pages
- Improve SEO meta tags (OpenGraph, Twitter)
- Implement caching strategies (SWR revalidation, DRF caching)
- Set up proper testing framework (Jest + React Testing Library)

## Active Decisions
- **Docker Configuration**: Successfully implemented with all services communicating
- **Environment Variables**: Resolved encoding issues and properly configured
- **Django Models**: Core models implemented and working
- **API Structure**: REST API with versioning is operational
- **Frontend Framework**: Next.js with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS confirmed working
- **Database**: PostgreSQL successfully configured with migrations
- **Auth Strategy**: Admin-only authentication for content management implemented
- **Component Design**: PostCard component design established as pattern for other UI components
- **Homepage Layout**: Two-section layout with featured posts at top and regular post grid below
- **Pagination Strategy**: Infinite scroll for regular posts grid using Intersection Observer
- **Post Grid Layout**: Responsive grid (3 columns on desktop, 2 on tablet, 1 on mobile)
- **Data Fetching Strategy**: Server-side rendering for initial load with client-side for subsequent data

## Current Challenges
- Ensuring proper media file handling and optimization
- Addressing TypeScript linting errors in frontend
- Implementing infinite scroll efficiently without performance issues
- Testing infinite scroll with varying network conditions
- Optimizing initial page load performance
- Improving error handling in API views
- Securing Celery worker (currently runs with superuser privileges)
- Planning for efficient development workflow across frontend and backend
- Implementing proper caching strategies
- Addressing possible deployment considerations

## Ongoing Discussions
- Best approach for implementing search functionality
- Refinement of frontend component architecture
- Media storage and delivery optimization
- Newsletter integration options
- Caching strategies for API responses
- Deployment workflow considerations
- Potential CI/CD pipeline setup
