# Active Context

## Current Focus
✅ **PRODUCTION DEPLOYMENT SYSTEM COMPLETED!**

Ho completato la creazione del sistema di deployment automatico per la VPS Hostinger (217.65.144.19). Il sistema include:

1. ✅ **Deploy Script Automatico** (`deploy.sh`) - Setup completo in 1 comando
2. ✅ **Docker Compose Production** (`docker-compose.prod.yml`) con Nginx reverse proxy
3. ✅ **Transfer Scripts** - Sia Bash che PowerShell per transfer file
4. ✅ **Nginx Configuration** - Reverse proxy ottimizzato per production
5. ✅ **Frontend Production Dockerfile** - Build ottimizzato Next.js
6. ✅ **Documentation Completa** - Guida step-by-step per deployment
7. ✅ **Backup & Update Scripts** - Automazione completa post-deployment

## Recent Changes
- Creato sistema di deployment production completo per VPS Hostinger
- Configurato Nginx reverse proxy per servire Django backend e Next.js frontend
- Ottimizzato Docker Compose per production con health checks e restart policies
- Creato script di transfer automatico sia per Linux/Mac che Windows
- Configurato sicurezza firewall e backup automatici
- Impostato Next.js production build con standalone output
- Configurato environment variables per production (IP 217.65.144.19)
- Creato documentazione completa per deployment e troubleshooting

## Next Steps
**DEPLOYMENT IMMEDIATO POSSIBILE!**

### **Per eseguire il deployment:**

**Opzione A - Windows (PowerShell):**
```powershell
.\production-deploy\transfer-files.ps1
ssh root@217.65.144.19
cd /opt/blog-production
./deploy.sh
```

**Opzione B - Linux/Mac (Bash):**
```bash
chmod +x production-deploy/transfer-files.sh
./production-deploy/transfer-files.sh
ssh root@217.65.144.19
cd /opt/blog-production
./deploy.sh
```

### **Risultato finale:**
- 🌐 **Website**: http://217.65.144.19
- 🔧 **Admin**: http://217.65.144.19/admin (admin/production123!)
- ⚡ **Setup automatico completo in ~10 minuti**

## Active Decisions and Considerations
- Utilizzo IP diretto (217.65.144.19) invece di dominio per semplicità
- Nginx reverse proxy gestisce routing tra Django e Next.js
- PostgreSQL containerizzato come in sviluppo per consistenza
- Backup automatici giornalieri configurati
- SSL/HTTPS rimandato a fase futura (facile da aggiungere)
- Firewall configurato per sicurezza base
- Gunicorn con 3 workers per performance
