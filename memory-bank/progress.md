## Current Status
All core components are now operational. We have successfully set up the Docker environment with Django, PostgreSQL, Redis, Celery, and Next.js containers. The Django backend is configured with models, API endpoints, and a working admin interface accessible with the superuser credentials (admin/admin123).

The frontend now features a fully implemented homepage with a modern layout that includes:
1. A featured posts section at the top showcasing important content
2. A responsive grid layout for regular posts
3. Infinite scroll functionality for loading additional posts as the user scrolls
4. Error handling for API failures
5. Loading states for improved user experience
6. Dark mode compatibility throughout all components

The data fetching is handled via server-side rendering for initial load and client-side fetching for subsequent data, providing optimal performance and SEO benefits.

## Known Issues
- Need to improve error handling in API views
- Media file uploads need proper handling and optimization
- Some TypeScript linting errors in the frontend that don't affect functionality
- Celery runs with superuser privileges (security warning)
- Potential need for more robust CORS configuration when deployed
- Need to test infinite scroll with large datasets to ensure performance

## Achievements
- Successful Docker environment setup with all services communicating
- Core Django models and API implementation
- PostgreSQL database configuration and migration
- Django admin interface working with superuser
- Next.js with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS setup
- Working API endpoints accessible from the frontend
- Environment configuration for development
- Responsive PostCard component with dark mode support
- Detailed homepage implementation plan finalized
- Complete implementation of homepage with featured posts and infinite scroll
