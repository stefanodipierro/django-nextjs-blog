## Current Status
All core components are now operational. We have successfully set up the Docker environment with Django, PostgreSQL, Redis, Celery, and Next.js containers. The Django backend is configured with models, API endpoints, and a working admin interface accessible with the superuser credentials (admin/adminpassword123).

The frontend now features a fully implemented homepage with a modern layout that includes:
1. A featured posts section at the top showcasing important content
2. A responsive grid layout for regular posts
3. Infinite scroll functionality for loading additional posts as the user scrolls
4. Category filtering with a horizontal tab navbar
5. Error handling for API failures
6. Loading states for improved user experience
7. Dark mode compatibility throughout all components

The data fetching is handled via server-side rendering for initial load and client-side fetching for subsequent data, providing optimal performance and SEO benefits.

The admin interface has been significantly enhanced with:
1. Rich text editing capabilities using Django-Summernote
2. Modern UI design and custom theming with Django-Admin-Interface
3. Improved navigation and organization of admin pages
4. Custom templates with statistics dashboard, environment indicator, and branded elements
5. Enhanced model admin classes for better content management
6. Functional admin dashboard with accurate content statistics via custom template tags
7. Clear environment indicator (DEV/PROD badge) for distinguishing environments

We've also implemented advanced content management features:
1. Scheduled post publishing using Celery for automatic publishing of posts at preset times
2. Secure Celery worker operations with a dedicated low-privilege user
3. Admin interface enhancements for scheduling with clear status indicators and bulk actions

SEO meta tags have been implemented and validated using Lighthouse and manual checks with platform-specific tools. Basic documentation and CI checks for SEO are also complete.

Recent fixes include solving a React hydration error in date rendering by using client-side only date formatting, and updating the environment configuration for better reliability.
