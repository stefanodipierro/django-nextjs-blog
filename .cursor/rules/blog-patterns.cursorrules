# Blog Project Patterns and Intelligence

## Project Patterns
- **Django App Structure**: Each functional area gets its own Django app (posts, categories, newsletter, search, etc.)
- **REST API Versioning**: All API endpoints are versioned (e.g., /api/v1/posts/)
- **Model-View-Serializer**: Follow Django REST Framework's pattern for API development
- **Containerized Services**: Each service (Django, Postgres, Redis, Next.js) has its own container
- **Environment-based Settings**: Different settings for development, testing, and production
- **Frontend Component Isolation**: React components are organized by functionality and reusability
- **Image URL Optimization**: External image URLs (like Picsum) are served directly rather than proxied through Django
- **Meta Tag Standardization**: All meta tags use absolute URLs generated dynamically

## User Preferences
- **Minimalist Design**: Clean, distraction-free interface with focus on content
- **Markdown Support**: All content editing uses markdown with preview
- **Dark Mode Support**: Application supports both light and dark themes
- **Zero User Accounts**: No user login or authentication required for reading
- **Scheduled Publishing**: Content can be scheduled for future publication
- **Image Optimization**: All images are automatically optimized for web
- **Category Filtering**: Featured posts can be filtered by category for improved navigation

## Known Challenges
- **Cross-Origin Requests**: Django backend and Next.js frontend run on different ports/domains
- **Media File Management**: Handling uploads and serving optimized images
- **Server-Side Rendering**: Ensuring proper SEO with dynamic content
- **Docker Development Workflow**: Keeping development experience smooth with containers
- **API Performance**: Optimizing API responses for frontend consumption
- **Dark Mode Implementation**: Consistent theming across all components
- **External vs. Internal Image URLs**: Differentiating between local media and external image sources

## Implementation Paths
- **Initial Setup**: Docker → Django Project → Next.js Project → Database
- **Backend Development**: Models → Admin → API → Background Tasks
- **Frontend Development**: Layout → Components → Pages → Theme → API Integration
- **Feature Implementation**: Core Blog → Search → Featured Posts → Newsletter → Social
- **Deployment Flow**: Local → CI/CD Pipeline → Staging → Production
- **SEO Optimization**: Meta Tags → Structured Data → Canonical URLs → Open Graph

## Tool Usage
- **Docker Compose**: Primary tool for development environment
- **pip/npm**: Package management
- **Django migrations**: Database schema management
- **Django admin**: Content management
- **DRF Browsable API**: API testing and documentation
- **React DevTools**: Frontend debugging
- **PostgreSQL CLI**: Database database management
- **Redis CLI**: Cache inspection

## Project Evolution
- **MVP Focus**: Initially focus on core blog functionality only
- **Feature Expansion**: Add newsletter and social sharing after core is stable
- **Performance Optimization**: Add caching and optimizations post-MVP
- **Monitoring Addition**: Add analytics and monitoring as project matures
- **Extension Points**: Design for future extensions without overengineering initially

## URL Handling Strategies
- **Internal Media**: URLs in the format `/media/posts/image.jpg` are transformed to `http://localhost:8000/media/posts/image.jpg` for rendering
- **External Media**: URLs like `http://localhost:8000/media/https%3A//picsum.photos/...` are transformed to direct URLs `https://picsum.photos/...` for meta tags
- **Canonical URLs**: All pages use absolute URLs (e.g., `http://localhost:3000/posts/my-post`) for canonical links and Open Graph tags
- **Social Sharing**: Image URLs in social sharing links use direct external URLs whenever possible for better compatibility
